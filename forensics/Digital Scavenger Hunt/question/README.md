Digital Scavenger Hunt
Category: Forensics

Difficulty: Easy

Description: We intercepted a classified package from a rogue operative just before they went dark. 
They claimed it was a photograph proving the location of the enemy base.
However, the operative triggered a "kill switch" on the file moments before we secured it.
Now, the system refuses to recognize it as a valid image. The data inside seems intact, but the file's identity has been sabotaged. 
Can you bypass the damage and view the evidence?
