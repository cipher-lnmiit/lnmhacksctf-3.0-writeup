# A Biased Model, 400 points

## Author: [bismuth01](https://www.github.com/bismuth01)

## Problem

I have made a model, but it seems pretty 'biased' in a particular layer...

A model weight file `challenge.pth` is given.

## Producing it

Use `biased.py` to generate `challenge.pth` which is made such that a particular layer has the biases set to ASCII values of the flag.
