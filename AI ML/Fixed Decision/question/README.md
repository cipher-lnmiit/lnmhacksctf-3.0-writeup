# Fixed Decision, 400 points

## Author: [bismuth01](https://www.github.com/bismuth01)

## Problem

The threshold for each feature tells me something in whole numbers ...

At least it's decision is fixed.

A weight file `logistic_challenge.pth` is given.

## Producing it

You can use `decision.py` to produce the weights file which essentially creates a logisitic regression model with the threshold decision boundary features to be ASCII values for the flag.
