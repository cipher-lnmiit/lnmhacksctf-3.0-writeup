## Author: (bismuth01)[https://www.github.com/bismuth01]

## Problem

Now your turn to be Akinator.

A web interface opens where the LLM selects a random object and you have to guess it in 20 questions to get the flag.

## Producing it

The npm project has been given, just make the docker container with the environment variables and run it.
